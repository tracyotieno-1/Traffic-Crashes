Predict The Primary Contributory Cause of Car Accidents

# Overview
### The Importance of Predicting Primary Contributory Causes of Traffic Accidents

Traffic accidents are a leading cause of injury and fatalities, and their impact extends beyond the individuals involved. Each incident can result in emotional trauma, economic losses, and strains on public resources, such as emergency services and infrastructure repair. The City of Chicago, like many metropolitan areas, experiences a high volume of accidents due to complex interactions among vehicles, pedestrians, infrastructure, and environmental conditions.

The primary goal of this project is to support the Vehicle Safety Board in its efforts to reduce traffic accidents across the city. By analyzing data from the electronic crash reporting system at the Chicago Police Department (E-Crash), this project aims to uncover patterns and insights that can inform actionable strategies.

Through predictive modeling, we can identify the primary contributory causes of accidents, enabling data-driven interventions that enhance road safety, optimize resource allocation, and guide policy decisions. This work is integral to creating safer roads and fostering a culture of proactive prevention in Chicago.
