Predict The Primary Contributory Cause of Car Accidents

# Overview
### The Importance of Predicting Primary Contributory Causes of Traffic Accidents

Traffic accidents are a leading cause of injury and fatalities, and their impact extends beyond the individuals involved. Each incident can result in emotional trauma, economic losses, and strains on public resources, such as emergency services and infrastructure repair. The City of Chicago, like many metropolitan areas, experiences a high volume of accidents due to complex interactions among vehicles, pedestrians, infrastructure, and environmental conditions.

The primary goal of this project is to support the Vehicle Safety Board in its efforts to reduce traffic accidents across the city. By analyzing data from the electronic crash reporting system at the Chicago Police Department (E-Crash), this project aims to uncover patterns and insights that can inform actionable strategies. Through predictive modeling, we can identify the primary contributory causes of accidents, enabling data-driven interventions that enhance road safety, optimize resource allocation, and guide policy decisions. This work is integral to creating safer roads and fostering a culture of proactive prevention in Chicago.


# Problem Statement
Traffic accidents in Chicago pose a significant safety and economic challenge, yet the primary causes remain poorly understood despite data from the Chicago Police Department’s E-Crash system. This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify key contributory causes of accidents, enabling data-driven strategies for prevention. By uncovering actionable insights, the project supports the Vehicle Safety Board in reducing accidents, optimizing resource allocation, and making Chicago’s roads safer for all.

# Objectives
- Identify high-risk locations for traffic accidents to prioritize interventions like increased patrols, signage, or infrastructure improvements.
- Analyze the role of driver behaviors, such as speeding or distracted driving, to guide public awareness campaigns and enforcement strategies.
- Understand how the timing of accidents impacts crash severity to optimize resource deployment during high-risk periods.

# Data Sources
The data is sourced from the electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) at the Chicago Police Department which includes:
- Crash identification details and timing
- Location and road characteristics
- Environmental factors
- Crash characteristics and severity

# Stakeholders
- Government and Public Agencies i.e Vehicle Safety Board
- Policy Makers and Urban Planners
- Public Health and Safety Organizations
- General Public and Road Users

# Research Questions
- What are the most common primary contributory causes of traffic accidents?
- Which geographic locations or traffic hot spots have the highest frequency of accidents?
- How do human behavioral factors contribute to crash occurrences?
